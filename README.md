CIS195 Final Project - Fall 2014

Proposal:
Names: Kate Miller, Q Kalantary Pennkey: katmill, qkal
App title: GridChat
General description/Describe at a high level what your app will do: GridChat will facilitate group conversation for those in physical proximity.
What is the purpose of this app?
GridChat is ideal for use at festivals, concerts, and other large events. Perfect for quickly disseminating information to large networks of volunteers or attendees.
Describe why your app is final project worthy.
YikYak is popular because people enjoy hearing about the experiences of those close to them with the benefit of anonymity. GridChat allows real­time discussion of events or topics of interest.
Explain what makes this app difficult enough to be a final project.
We haven’t implemented any type of messaging projects in the course. Additionally, we may generate enough volume of messages to necessitate some external storage of group chats, or develop an effective method of determining when messages can safely be deleted, perhaps through some user feedback/voting system.
List the features you intend to implement and anything else you need to do.
We will need to design a logo and navigable interface, as well as make many design decisions ­ can members chat in multiple groups? Do we want to support a “global” chat room, accessible from anywhere? What data do we store locally, what to do clear and when, what, if anything, do we store on an Amazon­type web server?
Features: Facebook login*, allow users to initiate a chat room for a physical area that other users are able to then join or mute
Frameworks: MapKit; Parse; PubNub Data Stream
*Additional Notes:
We will need to decide on the question of anonymity (facebook would be a convenient mechanism for logging in). Do we want to support an anonymous chat function?
